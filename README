I have created hybrid framework which is an combination of TestNG, Cucumber & JUnit.

-Ways of framework execution:
	1.Run as JUnit (Write click on TestRunner file- Run As- JUnit Test)
	2.Run as Cucumber Feature (Write click on any feature file- Run As- Cucumber Feature)
	3.Run as TestNG Test (First we need to modify test runner file as -
	//To convert the framework into testNG then extend this abstract class and remove @RunWith annotation.
	then write click on TestRunner file- Run As- TestNG Test)
	4.Run as Maven Test (Write click on Project folder or POM.xml file- Run As- Maven Test)
	5.Run via CMD Prompt (Open cmd from project location then enter cmd clear & cmd test/verify)
	6.Run with Batch file (I have created batch file which has .bat extension just double click on it from project location
	then it will execute the framework).
	
-Reports:
I have created different types of reports like (html, json, junit, extended report with proper failed cases screenshot), check test runner file
All those reports are automatically get saved at target folder and test-output folder.

Note=
- I have written test cases on 3 modules of the given build.
- I have created Utility package and class to write generic methods like waits, javascript operations, browser opening code, etc)
- I have created AppHooks for initializing data from feature file and for writing the screenshot code.
- I have implemented Page Object Model

+IMP Note= Initial loading of URL is very slow so please wait until it finish loading and execute further steps from feature file.
